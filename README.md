# About previous assignments

The previous assignments are pushed to separate branches with the following names.
For assgnment 1, I submitted the assignment and shared the repo on time. However, it was later renamed to rahman-iOS to make it easier to track. The repo is also shared with BSUMobileDev.

The project was copied and pasted into the rahman-iOS repo which has already been shared with BSUMobileDev for grading. That's why rahman-iOS only has one commit for this assignment even though I worked on the project for 2-3 days.
